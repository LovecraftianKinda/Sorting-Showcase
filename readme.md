# Sorting Algorithm Showcase

## Development Goals

- Implement various sorting algorithms.
- Compare the performance of different sorting algorithms.
- Visually represent the sorting process for each algorithm.

## Sorting Algorithms

1. **Bubble Sort**
    - Average Time Complexity : O(n^2)
2. **Selection Sort**
    - Average Time Complexity : O(n^2)
3. **Insertion Sort**
    - Average Time Complexity : O(n^2)
4. **Merge Sort**
    - Average Time Complexity : O(n log(n))
5. **Quick Sort**
    - Average Time Complexity : O(n log(n))
6. **Heap Sort**
    - Average Time Complexity : O(n log(n))
7. **Tim Sort**
    - Average Time Complexity : O(n log(n))

## Visual Representation

- Use graphical tools to animate the sorting process.
- Highlight the comparisons and swaps made by each algorithm.
- Show the progression of the list from unsorted to sorted.

## Performance Comparison

- Measure the time complexity of each algorithm.
- Compare the number of comparisons and swaps.
- Analyze the best, average, and worst-case scenarios for each algorithm.

## Conclusion

- Summarize the strengths and weaknesses of each sorting algorithm.
- Provide recommendations for which algorithms to use in different scenarios.
